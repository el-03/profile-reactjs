# profile-reactjs
One single web pages about me that written using reactjs, and this is my first project using react.

There is only one external package that used:
1. https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll

For now, although for desktop view there is no serious problems, the page is not fully responsive for mobile use. However in the future i'll try to update it.

if there's any suggestions, please kindly to tell me :)
